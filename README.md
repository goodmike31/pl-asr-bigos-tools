# pl-asr-bigos-tools
This repository contains tools for benchmarking ASR systems using BIGOS corpora.<br>
BIGOS (Benchmark Intended Grouping of Open Speech) corpora collects and unifies publicly available ASR speech datasets.<br>
Currently Polish language is supported.<br>
BIGOS family corpora are available at the Hugging Face platform: <br>
* [BIGOS V2](https://huggingface.co/datasets/amu-cai/pl-asr-bigos-v2).<br>
* [PELCRA for BIGOS](https://huggingface.co/datasets/pelcra/pl-asr-pelcra-for-bigos)<br>

Both BIGOS V2 and PELCRA for BIGOS corpora are intended for evaluation of community-provided ASR systems as part of the 2024 PolEval challenge.<br>
Evaluation results on [BIGOS V1](https://huggingface.co/datasets/michaljunczyk/pl-asr-bigos) are available in the [paper](https://annals-csis.org/proceedings/2023/drp/pdf/1609.pdf)<br>
Hugging Face leaderboard for systematic evaluation of publicly available ASR systems for Polish is under construction.<br>
