# pl-asr-bigos-tools
This repository contains tools for benchmarking ASR systems using BIGOS corpora.
BIGOS (Benchmark Intended Grouping of Open Speech) corpora collects publicly available ASR speech datasets for Polish.
The corpus is available at the [Hugging Face platform](https://huggingface.co/datasets/michaljunczyk/pl-asr-bigos).
The results of the initial BIGOS-based evaluation of publicly available ASR systems are available in the [paper](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/370983845_BIGOS_-_Benchmark_Intended_Grouping_of_Open_Speech_Corpora_for_Polish_Automatic_Speech_Recognition)
Hugging Face leaderboard for systematic evaluation of publicly available evaluation is under construction.
Community-provided ASR systems evaluation is under preparation as part of the 2024 PolEval challenge.
