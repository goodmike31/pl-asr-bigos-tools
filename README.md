The corpus is available at the [Hugging Face platform](https://huggingface.co/datasets/michaljunczyk/pl-asr-bigos).<br>
The results of the initial BIGOS-based evaluation of publicly available ASR systems are available in the [paper](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/370983845_BIGOS_-_Benchmark_Intended_Grouping_of_Open_Speech_Corpora_for_Polish_Automatic_Speech_Recognition)<br>
Hugging Face leaderboard for systematic evaluation of publicly available evaluation is under construction.<br>
Community-provided ASR systems evaluation is under preparation as part of the 2024 PolEval challenge.<br>
